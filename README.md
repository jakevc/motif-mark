# motif-mark

TO DO:

 - proper color generation, one per motif in motifs.txt
 - motif legend
 - dynamically scale length of image to number of seqs 
 - test on other sequences



MBNL and RBFOX regulate splicing in a similar manner, binding both up and downstream the alternatively spliced exon. 

The two factors have similar motifs, and are known to regulate each others binding sites.


MBNL1 and RBFOX1 work together to regulate splicing events in transcripts that are regulated by both.


Develop a Python script to plot protein binding motifs on an image of
the an exon and flanking introns
